= Import

Here, you can import project archives such as the example projects provided on our website or
projects exported from the <<sect_projects_export>> tab.

When a user with the role *project creator* imports a project, that user automatically becomes a
*manager* of the imported project. However, no permissions for the project are imported!

NOTE: If the current instance has users with the same name as those who originally worked on the
      import project, the manager can add these users to the project and they can access their annotations.
      Otherwise, only the imported source documents are accessible.
      
When a user with the role *administrator* imports a project, the user can choose whether to *import
the permissions* and whether to *automatically create users* who have permissions on the imported
project but so far do not exist. If this option to create missing users disabled, but the option to
import permissions is enabled, then projects still maintain their association to users by name.
If the respective user accounts are created manually after the import, the users will start showing
up in the projects.

NOTE: Automatically added users are disabled and have no password. They must be explicitly enabled
      and a password must be set before the users can log in.
