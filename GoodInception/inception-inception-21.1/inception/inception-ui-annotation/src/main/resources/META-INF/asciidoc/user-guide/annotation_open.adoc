= Opening a Document

When navigating to the *Annotation* page, a dialogue opens that allows you to select a project, and 
a document within the project. If you want to open a different project or document later, click on 
*Open* to open the dialog.

Projects appear as folders, and contain the documents of the project. Double-click on a document to 
open it for annotation. Document names written in black show that the document has not been opened 
by the current user, blue font means that it has already been opened, whereas red font indicates 
that the document has already been marked as *done*.

Users that are managers can additionally open other users' documents to view their annotations but cannot change them.
This is done by selecting the project, user and then document in the described dialogue. The user's own name is listed at the top and marked _(me)_.
