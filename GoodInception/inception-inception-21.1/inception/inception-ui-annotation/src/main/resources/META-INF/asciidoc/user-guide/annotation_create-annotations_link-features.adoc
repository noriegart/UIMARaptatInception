= Link Features

Link features can be used to link one annotation to others. Before a link can be made, a slot must 
be added. If role labels are enabled enter the role label in the text field and press the *add* 
button to create the slot. Next, click on field in the newly created slot to *arm* it. The field's 
color will change to indicate that it is armed. Now you can fill the slot by double-clicking on a 
span annotation. To remove a slot, arm it and then press the *del* button.

.Navigating along links
Once a slot has been filled, there is a cross-hair icon in the slot field header which can be used
to navigate to the slot filler.

When a span annotation is selected which acts as a slot filler in any link feature, then the 
annotation owning the slow is shown in the annotation detail panel. Here, the cross-hair icon can be used to jump to the slot owner.

.Role labels
If role labels are enabled they can be changed by the user at any time.
To change a previously selected role label, no prior deletion is needed.
Just double-click on the instance you want to change, it will be highlighted in orange, and chose
another role label.

If role labels are disabled for the link feature layer they cannot be manually set by the user.
Instead the UI label of the linked annotation is displayed.
