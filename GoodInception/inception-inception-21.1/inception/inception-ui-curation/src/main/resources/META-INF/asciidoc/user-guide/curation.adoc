[[sect_curation]]
= Curation

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *curators*.

When navigating to the *Curation Page*, the procedure for opening projects and documents is the same as in <<sect_annotation>>. The navigation within the document is also equivalent to <<sect_annotation>>.

In the left frame of the window, named *Sentences*, an overview of the chosen document is displayed. Sentences are represented by their number inside the document. Click on a sentence in order to select it and to to edit it in the central part of the page.

The sentences are shown using different colors that indicate their state. Since the calculation of
the state can take significant time, it is not updated as changes are made in the main editor pane.
To update the coloring of the sentence overview, use the *Refresh* button. When switching between
documents, the overview is automatically refreshed.

NOTE: In order for the sentence overview to consider a sentence as *Curated*, the curation pane must
contain an annotation for all positions that any of the annotators have annotated. This implies
that the *Curated* state requires the curator to have made an annotation. It is not possible
at this time to mark a sentence as curated in which an annotator has made an annotator, but the
curator has not (e.g. because the curator considers the annotator's annotation to be entirely
wrong and misplaced).

The center part of the annotation page is divided into the *Annotation* pane which is a full-scale
annotation editor and contains the final data from the curation step. Below it are multiple read-only
panes containing the annotations from individual annotators. Clicking on an annotation in any of the
annotator's panes transfers the respective annotation to the *Annotation* pane.

When a document is opened for the first time in the curation page, the application analyzes agreements
and disagreements between annotators. All annotations on which all annotators agree are automatically
copied to the *Annotation* pane. Any annotations on which the annotators disagree are skipped.

The annotator's panes are color-coded according to their relation with the contents of the *Annotation* pane and according to the agreement status. The colors largely match the colors also used in the status over in the left sidebar.

NOTE: The upper *Annotation* pane that the curator uses to edit annotations is not color-coded. It uses whatever coloring strategy is configured in the *Settings* dialog.

|===
| Green 
| *Accepted by the curator:* the annotation matches the corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane.

| Cyan 
| *Rejected by the curator: *the annotation does not match the corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane.

| Orange
| *Annotators agree:* the annotators all agree but curator has not accepted the annotation yet (there is no corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane).

| Red
| *Annotators disagree:* the annotators disagree and the curator has not yet taken any action (there is also no corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane).

| Purple
| *Annotation is incomplete:* not all annotators have provided a annotation for this position and the curator has not yet taken any action (there is no corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane).

**Left-click** on an annotation in one of the lower panels to merge it. This action copies the annotation to the upper panel. The merged annotation will turn green in the lower panel from which it was selected. If other annotators had a conflicting opinion, these will turn red in the lower panels of the respective annotators. 

**Right-click** on an annotation in the lower panels to bring up a menu with additional options.

* **Merge all XXX**: merge all annotations of the given type from the selected annotator. Note that
  this overrides any annotations of the type which may previously have been merged or manually 
  created in the upper panel.

[#merging-strategies]
== Merging strategies
By default, the merging strategy only considers annotations if all annotators made the same 
annotation at the same location (i.e. complete and agreeing annotations) - i.e. it considers any 
annotations not provided by all annotators as a disagreement between the annotators.

However, there are situations where it is desirable to merge annotations from all annotators, even
if some did not provide it. For example, if your project has two annotators, one working on POS
tagging and another working on lemmatization, then as a curator, you might simply want to merge the
annotators from the two. This can be done by using the **Re-merge** action and activating the
checkbox **Merge incomplete annotations**. This will re-merge the current document (i.e. discard
the entire state of curation and merge from scratch).

== Anonymized curation
By default, the curator can see the annotators names on the curation page. However, in some cases,
it may not be desirable for the curator to see the names. In this case, enable the option
*Anonymous curation* in the project detail settings. Users with the curator role will then only
see an anonymous label like *Anonymized annotator 1* instead of the annotator names. Users who are
project managers can still see the annotator names.

NOTE: The order of the annotators is not randomized - only the names are removed from the UI. Only 
      annotators who have marked their documents as *finished* are shown. Thus, which annotator recieves 
      which number may changed depending on documents being marked as finished or put back into progress.
