[[sect_remote_api_webhooks]]
= Webhooks

Webhooks allow {product-name} to notify external services about certain events. For example, an 
external service can be triggered when an annotator marks a document as finished or when all 
documents in a project have been completely curated.

Webhooks are declared in the `settings.properties` file. For every webhook, it is necessary to 
specify an URL (`url`) and a set of topics (`topics`) about with the remote service listening at the
given URL is notified. If the remote service is accessible via https and the certificate is not
known to the JVM running {product-name}, the certificate verification can be disabled
(`verify-certificates`). 

The following topics are supported:

* `DOCUMENT_STATE` - events related to the change of a document state such as when any user starts
  annotating or curating the document.
* `ANNOTATION_STATE` - events related to the change of an annotation state such as when a user
  starts or completes the annotation of a document.
* `PROJECT_STATE` - events related to the change of an entire project such as when all documents
  have been curated.
