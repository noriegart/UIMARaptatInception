[[sect_remote_api]]
= Remote API

====
INFO: To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `remote-api.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
====

In order to programmatically manage annotation project, a REST-like remote API is offered. This API
is disabled by default. In order to enable it, add the setting `remote-api.enabled=true` to the
`settings.properties` file.

Once the remote API is enabled, it becomes possible to assign the role `ROLE_REMOTE` to a user. Create a new user, e.g. `remote-api` via the user management page and assign at least the roles `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_REMOTE`. Most of the actions accessible through the remote API require administrator access, so adding the `ROLE_ADMIN` is usually necessary as well.

Once the remote API has been enabled, it offers a convenient and self-explanatory web-based user interface under `<APPLICATION_URL>/swagger-ui.html` which can be accessed by any user with the role `ROLE_REMOTE`. Here, you can browse the different operations, their parameters, and even try them out directly via a web browser. The actual AERO remote API uses `<APPLICATION_URL/api/aero/v1` as the
base URL for its operations.

The API follows the link:https://openminted.github.io/releases/aero-spec/1.0.0/omtd-aero/[Annotation Editor Remote Operations (AERO) protocol].

The third-party Python library link:https://pycaprio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[pycaprio] can be used
to facilitate accessing the remote API.
