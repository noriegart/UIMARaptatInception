 * Annotation overlap mode.

 * For span layers, overlap is defined in terms of the span offsets. If any character offset that is
 * part of span A is also part of span B, then they are considered to be <b>overlapping</b>. If two
 * spans have exactly the same offsets, then they are considered to be <b>stacking</b>. Note that in
 * UIMA spans are half-open intervals [begin,end), such that a begin offset which is equal to the
 * end offset of another span does not entail that the two spans are overlapping - they are
 * adjacent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For relation layers, overlap is defined in terms of the end points of the relation. If two
 * relations share any end point (source or target), they are considered to be <b>overlapping</b>.
 * If two relations have exactly the same end points, they are considered to be <b>stacking</b>.
