= Upgrading via export/import

This option can be used when performing an upgrade by exporting all data from once instance of
the application into another instance which may potentially reside on a different machine. It
is a very tedious approach because there is no option to bulk-export all projects.

* Log into WebAnno and export all the projects that you wish to migrate using the *Export* pane in the project settings
* Move your WebAnno home folder to a safe location so that WebAnno and create a new home folder in the old location
* Copy the *settings.properties* back from your moved folder
* Start the new WebAnno version to initialize the database
* Recreate the users
** If you are using MySQL
*** create a new database for the new WebAnno version and update the *settings.properties* accordingly
*** use link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] to dump the tables `users` and `authorities` from the old database and load it back into the new database
** If you are not using MySQL, you have to recreate the users manually
* When upgrading to WebAnno 2.x from a pre 2.x version, remove the *format.properties* file from the WebAnno home folder
* Restart WebAnno and import the previously exported projects
