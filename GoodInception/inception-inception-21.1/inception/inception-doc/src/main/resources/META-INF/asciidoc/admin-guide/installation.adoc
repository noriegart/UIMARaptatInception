[[sect_installation]]
= Installation

You can run {product-name} on any major platform supporting Java, i.e. Linux, macOS or Windows.
However, we do not provide explicit support for setting up a production-ready instance of each of these
platforms. 

This guide assumes Debian 9.1 (Stretch). It may also work on Ubuntu with some modifications, but we
do not test this. Instructions for other Linux distributions and other platforms (i.e. macOS and 
Windows) likely deviate significantly.

It is further assumed that the user *www-data* already exists on the system and that it shall be used to run the application.

All commands assume that you are logged in as the *root* user. 

NOTE: If you cannot log in as root but have to use `sudo` to become root, then the recommended way 
      to do that is using the command `sudo su -`.
